musicd protocol, version 2 (working draft
=========================================

Messages are of following structure:

type
key1=value1
key2=value2

Components of message are separated by newlines (\n). The first line shall only
contain type of the message, and following lines contain one key/value property
pair each. An empty line terminates a message.

For every binary data property, of following syntax
key:=size
will follow size amount of bytes after the message's two terminating newlines.

List properties are comma separated values:
key=value1,value2

All client messages must generate an immediate reply from the server. Server
can also push messages - clients don't have to give the server any response for
them.

Any error, be it client's protocol-incompliant message, client's invalid or
impossible request or server side error, will cause the server to send a
message of following structure.

error
name string

In error condition, server is not required to give client any normal reply for
message that triggered the error.

Connecting
==========

When a client connects to a server, the server shall push following message

musicd
protocol integer (required)
codecs list

Protocol defines protocol version used for communication. Optional property
codecs defines what codecs the server is able to transcode to on client's
request.

After this client most likely must authorize itself. After authorization client
can begin sending requests normally.
